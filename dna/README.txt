The program in dna.py takes in a file containing DNA information and outputs a
file that contains the parsed data.

To run this program, enter this command in the command line:
	python dna.py

In this directory, I have supplied two test files: test-file1.txt and 
test-file2.txt. 

When prompted to enter input file, enter one of the two test files. 

When prompted to enter a output file, enter the name of the file you would like 
the output to be stored in.
