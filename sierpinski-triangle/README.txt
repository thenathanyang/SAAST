The program in sierp-triangle.py draws and ouputs a picture of a Sierpinski 
Triangle. The file drawingpanel.py was provided to us so that we could create a
graphical representation of our Sierpinski Triangle. The code I wrote can be 
found in the sierp-triangle.py file.

To run this program, enter this command in the command line:
	python sierp-triangle.py
