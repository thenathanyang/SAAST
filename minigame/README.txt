This project was part of a larger class-wide project of Pygame minigames we made
for the computer science program at the University of Pennsylvania's Summer 
Academy in Applied Science and Technology (SAAST). 

The framework to run the game can be found under Week 3, Day 14 at:

The game.py file contains the code for my portion of the larger set of games.

The Summer Academy in Applied Science and Technology is now known as the 
Engineering Summer Academy at Penn (ESAP).
